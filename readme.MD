  <h1>Isac's First 3D Engine</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Isac's first attempt at building a 3D engine! 🚀</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This project represents Isac's journey into the world of 3D graphics programming. It's a work-in-progress and a testament to the first steps taken during the initial week of learning.</p>

  <h2>Features (or Planned Features)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic rendering pipeline setup</li>
    <li>Mesh loading functionality</li>
    <li>Simple shading and lighting experiments</li>
    <li>Camera controls</li>
    <li><em>More features to be added as the project progresses!</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>As of now, the engine is not ready for production or general use. However, if you'd like to explore or contribute:</p>
